    headline: Left Side
    content: I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again,
      I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Could
      someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Maybe we better talk
      out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Now, how the hell
      do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves?

    content: Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. We know you're
      dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant
      Worf. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Earl
      Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion?

  content: I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Did you
    come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Ensign Babyface!
    Computer, lights up! I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Some days you get
    the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as
    keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.
